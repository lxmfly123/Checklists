# Checklists

## The First Usable App I Made

It's a simple todo-list App which has a 2-level-menu user interface. All user operations are triggered by buttons and animated demonstrate the execution result. But the animation code is a little messy, since I did not know how to use *Core Animation* and *block* (let alone *pop*)then. And customize animation in `UITableView` is tricky. But finally, here it is. 

## Feature

* CoreData Data Persistence
* Vivid Animation
* Allowed to Send Local Notifications at Designated Time
